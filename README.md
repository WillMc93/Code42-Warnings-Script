Tickets start with email suppressed and appear to be entered by COB Technician.

* This script currently doesn't have any error checking. It does print the status of each created ticket to the console, but doesn't handle it or make it extremely-readable (it is readable).
* This will be converted into a executable for use on Windows soon.
